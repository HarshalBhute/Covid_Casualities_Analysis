# Covid Death and Vaccine Analytics and Data Visualizations

## Objective:- To showcase Data Analytics Skills

## Skills:- SQL and Tableau

Initially DataSet was taken from website ```https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths```\
Data was downloaded as __xsls__ format i.e Excel sheet.\
Later the Dataset was __imported__ to __SQL__ to perform some queries and manipulate data according to our need.\
Further the new data was __exported__ to excel sheet which was used by Tableau for Data Visualization.

Once Data was extracted __Exploratory Data Analysis__ [EDA] was done some insights were drawn from it.\
Four different Queries were made
1. Total Cases, Total Death and Death Percentage Globally.
2. Total Death Counts according to location.
3. Highest Infection Count and Percent Population Infected according to location and total population of particular location.
4. Highest Infection Count and Percent Population Infected according to date, location and total population of particular location.

Later Data Visualization was done using __Tableau__.\
Different Visualizations were made on different sheets in tableau and then combine Dashboard was made.

__Insights__ found in Visualization.\
1.__Czechia__ country has most percent population infected.\
2.__Greenland__ had null covid symptoms.\
3.__China__ suprisingly had 0.01 percent population infected.\
4.__United States__ and __United Nations__ had sudden hike after March 2021.\
5.__Europe__ continet had maximum death counts whereas __Oceania__ has least death counts.
